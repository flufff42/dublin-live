===========

Dublin Bus Live Backend â€” Get live information from Dublin Bus including departure monitors at stops and vehicule positions
on maps and route schematics.

This is the backend for http://dublin.lsr.li written in Perl using the [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us) web framework.

It is currently rather messy and undergoing continuous changes as small tweaks are made to the site.
